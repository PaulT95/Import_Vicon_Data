# How it works 
This simple function permits to import properly all data stored in a txt or csv file exported with Vicon Nexus.
It imports the data in different structs with the name saved in Nexus for each channel/marker:

- Frequencies (will contain up to 3 variables with the frequencies of Analog data, Marker and Model Outputs)
- Labels (of the analog, markers, and model outputs for using in a for/do while loop)
- Analog
- Markers (e.g. HEAD_Marker with 3 columns which correspond to X,Y,Z)
- Model Outputs

Tested and worked on both TXT and CSV exported from Vicon Nexus 2.6, 2.7, and 2.12 

BE CAREFUL about the outputs you export from Vicon Nexus as they can affect the locations of the references in the program
